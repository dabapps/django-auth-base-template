**Switchable logged in/logged out base templates for Django.**

Overview
========

Often, a web application includes some pages (corporate blogs, Terms & Conditions, FAQs etc) which should be visible to both logged in and logged out visitors. However, these pages should include different structural elements for each type of user. For example, logged out visitors might see a "Register Now!" link in the header, whereas authenticated users might see the application's navigation menus.

The DRYest way to do this is with the magic of Django's template inheritance. Everything common to both types of user should be in a global `base.html` template. Page elements only visible to logged in users should be in `logged_in_base.html`, while elements only visible to logged out users should be in `logged_out_base.html`. Both of these should extend `base.html`.

Finally, your actual site pages should extend either `logged_in_base.html` or `logged_out_base.html` depending on whether the current user is authenticated. This is where **django-auth-base-template** can help.

Installation
============

Install from PyPI:

    pip install django-auth-base-template

Add the context processor to your `TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS` list:

    TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS = [
        ...
        'auth_base_template.context_processors.auth_base_template',
        ...
    ]

Add two settings to identify the templates to use:

    LOGGED_IN_BASE_TEMPLATE = 'logged_in_base.html'
    LOGGED_OUT_BASE_TEMPLATE = 'logged_out_base.html'

Usage
=====

First, create a global `base.html` template for your site:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head><title>My Site</title></head>
    <body>
        <div>{% block header %}</div>
        <div>{% block content %}</div>
    </body>
</html>
```

Create `logged_out_base.html`:

```
{% extends "base.html" %}
{% block header %}
    Welcome to the site! Register <a href="/register/">here</a>
{% endblock %}
```

Create `logged_in_base.html`:

```
{% extends "base.html" %}
{% block header %}
    Welcome back, member!
{% endblock %}
```

Finally, create one of your actual site pages:

```
{% extends auth_base_template %}
{% block content %}
    Blog! You can see this whether
    you're logged in or not!
{% endblock %}
```

Done!
